        The film was officially announced in April 2019 under the tentative title Suriya 39,
         as it was to be the actor's 39th film as a leading actor; however, it was shelved due to the COVID-19
          pandemic in India and work conflicts. The project restarted in August 2022, under the tentative title
           Suriya 42. Principal photography commenced the same month and lasted for seventeen months before wrapping 
           up in January 2024. Filming locations included Chennai, Goa, Kerala, Kodaikanal and Rajahmundry. The film has 
           music composed by Devi Sri Prasad, cinematography handled by Vetri Palanisamy and editing by Nishadh Yusuf. 
           Produced on a budget of around ₹300–350 crore, it is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made.
        
        Kanguva was released worldwide on 14 November 2024 in standard, 3D and IMAX format.
         The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who praised Suriya's performance,
          and the film's cinematography, but criticised the lazy writing, poor screenplay, editing and the sound, 
          calling it loud and emerged a box-office bomb.[12]</h3>
